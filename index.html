            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is <em>Oswald Cunningam</em>, i am currently a software engineering student at General Assembly, in Atlanta. My previous background in Retail Management and Marketing was not filling the void of being a contributer to society and making a stamp on society, so i decided to swicth carrer paths and become a Sofware Engineer. I am fueled by my passion for understanding the nuances of technology in this forever evolving world we live in. I consider myself as a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my academic foundations in computer programming and stay in tune with the latest coding strategies through continued coursework.

            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>My hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has been contributed to my most recent success at Enterprise Holdings, where I led in state-wide, marketing campaigns for Enterprise, National and Alamo. Meanwhile, I vastly improved the productivity of my team by implementing strategic management methods and ensuring a work-life balance for the department.</p>
